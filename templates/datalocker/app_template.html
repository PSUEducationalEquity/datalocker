    This template exists to make it easy to customize some of the site wide
    features in main_template.html without having to completely replace
    main_template.html in your product.

    To utilize this feature, create a Django application that is loaded after
    the `datalocker` application in `INSTALLED_APPS`.
    Within your Django application, create a file:
        templates\datalocker\app_template.html

    In that file, you can redefine any of the {% block %} elements that exist
    in main_template.html.
